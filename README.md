METWOBA is an overarching offensive statistic for Major League Baseball. Computations are inspired by wOBA created by Fangraphs (https://library.fangraphs.com/offense/woba/). Here we calculate weights for each of the "successful" outcomes (BB, HBP, 1B, 2B, 3B, HR), apply these weights to each outcome and divide by plate appearances. For the batted ball outcomes, exit velocity and launch angle are weighted according to effectiveness and also applied to reward better contact versus weak hits.
